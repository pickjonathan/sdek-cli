# Feature 003: AI Context Injection - Full Workflow Success ✅

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** WORKING END-TO-END  
**Test Type:** Live API Integration Test

## Summary

Successfully implemented and tested the complete `sdek ai analyze` command with real OpenAI API integration. The system correctly:
1. Loads policy excerpts
2. Loads evidence from multiple sources
3. Displays interactive TUI preview
4. Calls OpenAI GPT-4 with context injection
5. Parses AI response into structured Finding
6. Exports to JSON with full metadata

## Test Command

```bash
./sdek ai analyze \
  --config test_config.yaml \
  --framework SOC2 \
  --section CC6.1 \
  --excerpts-file ./testdata/ai/policies/soc2_excerpts.json \
  --evidence-path ./test_evidence/*.json
```

## Input Data

### Policy Context
- **Framework:** SOC2 2023
- **Section:** CC6.1 (Logical Access Controls)
- **Excerpt:** "The entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets to protect them from security events to meet the entity's objectives..."

### Evidence Events (3 total)
1. **event-001** (GitHub commit): Added MFA support with TOTP
2. **event-002** (GitHub commit): Updated password policy to 12+ chars with complexity
3. **event-003** (GitHub commit): Implemented 30-minute session timeout

## AI Analysis Results

### Finding Details
```json
{
  "id": "finding-CC6.1-1760779788",
  "control_id": "CC6.1",
  "framework_id": "SOC2",
  "title": "Partial Compliance with SOC2 CC6.1",
  "confidence_score": 0.9,
  "severity": "medium",
  "status": "open",
  "mode": "ai"
}
```

### AI Assessment
- **Confidence:** 90% (High)
- **Review Required:** No (confidence >= 70%)
- **Mapped Controls:** CC6.1
- **Citations:** All 3 events referenced

### Justification (Generated by GPT-4)
> "The evidence provided demonstrates that the entity has implemented logical access security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), complex password requirements, and session timeouts after periods of inactivity. These measures align with the policy requirements of SOC2 CC6.1, which mandates the implementation of logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures to protect information assets. However, there is no explicit evidence of the entity's procedures for registering and authorizing new users, or for removing access when it is no longer authorized."

### Residual Risk Assessment
> "There is a lack of evidence regarding the entity's procedures for registering and authorizing new users, or for removing access when it is no longer authorized. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to protected information assets."

### Provenance Tracking
- **Source:** github
- **Events Used:** 3

## Workflow Steps Verified

### ✅ Step 1: Load Policy Excerpts
- Loaded from `./testdata/ai/policies/soc2_excerpts.json`
- Correctly parsed SOC2 CC6.1 excerpt
- Built ContextPreamble with framework metadata

### ✅ Step 2: Load Evidence
- Glob pattern `./test_evidence/*.json` resolved correctly
- 3 events loaded from github_commits.json
- Events converted to EvidenceBundle format

### ✅ Step 3: TUI Context Preview
- Displayed framework (SOC2 2023)
- Displayed section (CC6.1)
- Displayed truncated policy excerpt (500 chars)
- Showed evidence count (3 events)
- Waited for user confirmation (auto-proceeded after 20s timeout)

### ✅ Step 4: Initialize AI Engine
- Config loaded from Viper (respects --config flag)
- AI enabled check passed
- OpenAI engine initialized with environment variable API key
- Provider: openai, Model: gpt-4

### ✅ Step 5: AI Analysis Call
- Built context-aware prompt with policy + evidence
- Called OpenAI API with function calling
- Structured output schema enforced
- Response latency: ~7.4 seconds

### ✅ Step 6: Parse AI Response
- Function call response parsed successfully
- Extracted all required fields:
  - title ✓
  - summary ✓
  - justification ✓
  - confidence_score ✓
  - residual_risk ✓
  - mapped_controls ✓
  - citations ✓
  - severity ✓

### ✅ Step 7: Build Finding Object
- Created Finding with proper structure
- Set ID: `finding-CC6.1-1760779788`
- Set timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Calculated review_required flag (false, 90% confidence)
- Built provenance from evidence sources

### ✅ Step 8: Export to JSON
- Saved to `findings.json`
- Valid JSON structure
- All fields properly serialized
- File written successfully

### ✅ Step 9: Display Summary
- Printed formatted summary to console
- Showed confidence score (90%)
- Showed residual risk assessment
- Showed mapped controls count
- Showed citations count

## Key Features Demonstrated

✅ Required fields enforced

### 3. Intelligent Analysis
✅ AI identified relevant security controls (MFA, passwords, sessions)  
✅ AI mapped evidence to CC6.1 requirements  
✅ AI identified gaps (user registration procedures)  
✅ AI provided actionable residual risk assessment  
✅ High confidence score (90%)

### 4. Quality Assurance

feature suggestions :

** I would like to provide govrenence controles in diffrent formats, then ai should know ( using MCP's ) to fetch the right data and create analysed reports.
For example, I would like to provide CSP ( Swift ) controles ( csv, excel, plain text) it should create a policy excerpts like in the /Users/pickjonathan/WorkSpacePrivate/sdek-cli/internal/policy/excerpts.go then understand the data it needs to fetch for example from aws account, then analyse the findings according to the policy and provide a report.

** When using AI we should inject befor analysing the security complience with data on the complience we are analysing and the specific section of the complience.
example, we wat to analyse SOC2 so first we inject the AI with the SOC2 context and the specific excerpts we would like to check, then it should based on the information provided return a response with the finding.
At the second phase the AI given the complience ( SOC2 ) and the specific excerpt should alone conclude the data it needs to collect, get it using MCPS ( githu, AWS etc ) then perform the analysis.

** Evidence collection using AI web browser to login for example to AWS then return a print screen of the evidance.

** VS code extention to help configure the cli, run reports and view them, also connect MCP's.

** Installing the sdek tool via homebrew and other similer package management tools for other os's
